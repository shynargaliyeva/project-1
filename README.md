# project-1: Blackjack Game

### Description

This project is an attempt to build a Blackjack game from scratch using what we've learned in the first two weeks of WDI. 
This is a very simple Blackjack game with initial features to follow basic rules. 


##### Basic rules or How to play:
  - Player places a bet
  - Player clicks New Deal to start the game
  - Player is dealt two cards; both cards face up
  - Dealer is dealt two cards; one face up, one face down
  - The goal is to beat the Dealer and score less than 21
  - If Dealer or Player score more than 21, then busted
  - If Players first two cards score equal 17-21, then Player would want to press "Stand"
  - If Players first two cards score equal 2-16, then Player would want to press "Hit"
  - If Player or a dealer have an 8 and an Ace, then it can be 19 or 9
  - If player or dealer score 21 on first two cards, then Blackjack and game stops. Whoever has Blackjack wins.
  - If 21 happens after first two cards, then itâ€™s just 21
